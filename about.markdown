Hi, I'm Emmett Young, a full-stack software engineer of Rakuten Asia, currently working in Singapore. 

I started working as a C# Windows Forms and PHP/jQuery developer in 2015. I only started working with Java in 2017 where I also learned about layered architecture, Maven, Gradle, Spring Boot, Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka, Hibernate, Liquibase, JUnit, Angular 6, Typescript, Docker, Ansible and TeamCity. 

You can check out my [featured portfolio](https://mettyoung.github.io/railway-routing-service/) which is a simple, containerized and monolithic web application deployed in the cloud that suggests train routes in Singapore!

The new technologies that I've learned in Rakuten are Jenkins, Kafka Connect, MongoDB, microservices architecture, Kubernetes, ReactJS and Redux.

Outside of work, I like watching animes and reading mangas/manhwas. 

Speaking of Manhwas, please read **Tower of God**. You'll thank me later!

Alright! Let's get back to ~~watching animes~~ coding! ðŸ¤ª
