I'm Emmett Young, born and raised in the Republic of Philippines. I'm a Chinese descandant where my ancestors originated from Xiamen, China. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineer in the top 3 universities - De La Salle University, Manila. After working 3 years as a full-stack engineer in the Philippines, I continued my software engineering career in Singapore where I eventually became a Permanent Resident.

If you want to know more about my experience and skill set, you can check my [CV](https://github.com/mettyoung/my-resume/blob/master/dist/Young_CV.pdf), my [projects](/projects) and even my [undergraduate thesis](https://github.com/mettyoung/visual-simultaneous-localization-and-mapping-co-operating-UAVs).
