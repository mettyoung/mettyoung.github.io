Hi, I'm Emmett Young, a full-stack software engineer at Rakuten Asia in Singapore!

I started working in 2015 as a C# Windows Forms and PHP/jQuery developer in the Philippines. I only started working with Java in 2017 where I also learned about layered architecture, Maven, Gradle, Spring Boot, Kafka, Hibernate, Liquibase, JUnit, Angular 6, Typescript, Docker, Ansible and TeamCity.

You can check out my [featured portfolio](https://mettyoung.github.io/railway-routing-service/) which is a simple, containerized and monolithic web application deployed in the cloud that suggests train routes in Singapore!

Some of the new technologies that I've learned in Rakuten are Jenkins, Kafka Connect, MongoDB, microservices architecture, Kubernetes, ReactJS and Redux.

Aside from work, I like watching animes and reading mangas/manhwas.

Speaking of Manhwas, please read [**Tower of God**](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/tower-of-god/list?title_no=95&page=1). You'll thank me later!

Alright! Let's get back to ~~watching animes~~ coding! ðŸ¤ª
