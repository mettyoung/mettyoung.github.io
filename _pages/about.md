I'm Emmett Young and I write code for a living.

I'm currently working as a full-stack software engineer at Rakuten Asia Singapore, mainly using Spring Boot and ReactJS!

To know more about my experience and skill set, you can check my [CV](https://github.com/mettyoung/my-resume/blob/master/dist/Young_CV.pdf) or even better, check my [projects](/projects) instead.
